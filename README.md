# 3D-Simulation-of-Standard-Manipulators
The repository contains 3 Dimensional Simulations of SCARA, PUMA and Stanford-type Manipulators. Contains codes to calculate the forward/inverse kinematics of the three manipulators. Also contains tools to calculate dynamic equations of any general manipulator from the Dh parameters.
